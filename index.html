							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>

							The area of cyber security is at a critical stage globally with the growing number of system breaches and identity fraud
							that we continue to read about - think about what happened at Target a year ago. This will continue to create a growing
							need for technology cyber specialists.</p>
							<p>
								Iowa State University researchers are now developing the nation's first computer security literacy curriculum designed
								for middle school and high school students.
							</p>
							<p>
								"This project will enable teachers across the state to be able to help their students be safer online and will continue
								to position ISU, hyperstream, and the state of Iowa as leaders in cyber security education," said Doug Jacobson, a university
								professor of electrical and computer engineering at Iowa State.
							</p>
							<p>
								One of the program areas of HyperStream/IT-Olympics is Cyber Defense. Nearly 30 teams are at compotetion this weekend competing
								in this venue. There is an existing cyber defense competition curriculum (developed by Iowa State University) that the students
								work with throughout the year.
							</p>
							<p>
								This new security literacy curriculum is in addition to and will enhance and supplement the existing cyber defense competition curriculum.

											As the demand for cybersecurity professionals grows,  teachers must have the tools necessary to prepare the future cybersecurity workforce. National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) provides a way for teachers to access a variety of available resources to help develop curricula and incorporate cybersecurity into their lesson plans.
